# Edge_AI_Squirrel_Tracker
Track squirrels attacking my bird-feeder using Raspberry Pi, Intel Movidius VPU, and Intel OpenVINO
## Updates
**25 Jan 2020** - This project is just getting started so it is quite a ways from a complete, usable solution.  Of course, designs are subject to radical change including core architecture.
## Initial Steps
1. Identify and order prototype hardware _In Progress_
2. Document requirements and features
3. Create project plan for implementation and testing
4. Start prototyping!
## Initial Parts List
* [Waterproof Electronics Box][Box Link]
  * Large, roomy box.  I plan to eventually add a tripod mount to it.
* [Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Board][Pi Link]
  * Didn't go with the Pi 4 because I don't want to deal with USB-C right now.  3 B+ should be powerful enough.
* [Intel Neural Compute Stick 2][VPU Link]
* [Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2][Camera Link]
  * I don't need IR, so sticking with the current "standard" Pi camera.
* [32GB MicroSDXC Memory Card][MemCard Link]
* [Universal Power Adapter][DCAdapter Link]
* [1 ft USB Extension Cable][USBCable Link]
* [Waterproof DC Adapter Plug][Plug Link]
### Future items
* Tripod Mounting Screw
* Simple mount that will work outdoors
* LiPo Battery
