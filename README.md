# Edge_AI_Squirrel_Tracker
Track squirrels attacking my bird-feeder using Raspberry Pi, Intel Movidius VPU, and Intel OpenVINO
## Updates
**25 Jan 2020** - This project is just getting started so it is quite a ways from a complete, usable solution.  Of course, designs are subject to radical change including core architecture.
**27 Jan 2020** - 

## Project Goals and Functions
The core goal of this project is to use computer vision at the edge to detect squirrels from a video feed.  Other features are subject to change as development and experimentation continue.

**ID**|**Feature**|**Category**
:-----:| ----- |:-----:
1|Given a video feed (camera or file), identifies when a squirrel is in frame|Core
2|Save recording of video when squirrel is in frame|Squirrel Event
3|Put a box around the squirrel in the recorded video frames|Squirrel Event
4|Sent alert notification when squirrel is in frame|Squirrel Event
5|Activate squirrel behavior modification (water spray?, audible alarm?, nerf gun robot?, specifics TBD)|Squirrel Event
6|Compact "single-box" design|Form Factor
7|Weatherproof|Form Factor
8|Runs on rechargable battery|Form Factor
9|DC input for running and/or charging|Form Factor

## Initial Steps
1. Identify and order prototype hardware - _Complete!_
2. Document requirements and features - _In Progress_
3. Create project plan for implementation and testing - _In Progress_
4. Start prototyping!
